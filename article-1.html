			<i>Dog Remembrance Day, February 27, printed on a calendar. </i>
		</p>
        <p style = "background-color:LightGrey;color:hsl(11, 77%, 25%)">
			The first major event for Dog since the implementation of Dog as the official mascot of the Wacky Racers Track Club is set to take place late February.
			<br><br>
			Dog Remembrance Day, February 27th, marks the anniversary of the first shipment of Dog Cards being received and distributed. This is the first time that this celebration will take place, and Dog hopes to make it a memorable event.

			Dog plans on printing a fourth version of their cards. These new cards will have a new twist: instructions for those who find them to submit a photo and location where they were found. This is in hopes to allow Dog to see if any of the cards have made their way to interesting places. 
			<br><br>
			This fixes a downside of the previous 3 versions, where they simply disappeared and there was almost no way to see who was impacted. This made it very difficult for the cards to be used for their purpose of inspiring others to join the cause.

			<p style = "background-color:LightGrey;color:hsl(11, 77%, 25%)">
			Dog Remembrance Day will also have much significance to the celebrators. Given that it has been one year since the original cards were released, there have been many changes to the organization that we will be reflecting on as well as the future to prepare for.
			<br><br>
			The first, and most obvious, is the change in leadership. Since August of 2024, Jerome Kawleski has left his position as a founder of the organization to attend college at UW-Stout. Even though he has continued to spread Dog while in Menomonie, he has not been able to lead any efforts to continue the cause.
			<br><br>
			His absences has left Tyce Xiong as the sole leader of Dog. This has come with many challenges, with the most obvious being funds for new cards. Because of this, he has begun selling shirts with the same design as the Wacky Racers Track Club Jerseys in hopes that this will raise enough funds for a new shipment of cards in time for Dog Remembrance Day. 
			<br><br>
			As for the future, Xiong will be joinging Kawleski next fall at UW-Stout, meaning that a new leader will have to step forward. There are many candidates for this position, with the four most obvious being Samuel Enders, Liam Hogan, and Garrett Strong, and Xavier Gilmeister. All four of these candidates have contributed time to spreading Dog, but the decision will ultimately come down to who has the most dedication to the movement. 
			</p>
			<p style = "font-size:200%">Dog Needs Your Help</p>
			<p style = "background-color:LightGrey;color:hsl(11, 77%, 25%)">
			For the time being, there is Dog to spread and goals the organization hopes to reach before leadership has to be handed over. The main goals for the remainder of the 2024-25 school year include increasing the volunteer team, finding young people who will carry on the cards, and building up the Dog Fund.
			<br><br>
			If you wish to contribute to the cause, you can purchase Dog shirts, currently selling for $5, or you can volunteer your time towards the cause. Purchasing a shirt will go towards the Dog Fund, and be used for purchasing the next shipment of cards. If you are interested in a shirt of volunteering, you can contact Dog at bulborbcards@gmail.com.
